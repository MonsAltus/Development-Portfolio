# Development-Portfolio
## Professional portfolio for web development projects.

### Description:
This page is a portfolio for displaying various projects of mine. Projects are periodically updated or switched out. 

The page has some basic response to viewport size, but my understanding and grasp of responsive development concepts like Flex and Grid need considerable work.
