# Development-Portfolio
## Professional portfolio for web development projects.

### Description:
This page is a concept for a portfolio of my personal projects. Most of the links are currently uncreative placeholders but will be updated as I complete more projects to display.

The page has some basic response to viewport size, but my understanding and grasp of responsive development concepts like Flex and Grid need considerable work.
